## Using open data

In this resource you will use the Google maps API to put open data onto a map using JavaScript.

Open data is data that is made available for public use, for free and without restrictions. All sorts of organisations publish open data, including governments, charities and companies. You can find open data on a wide variety of topics using a search engine.

Lots of cities publish their own open data. For this resource we are going to use some open data published by the city of Nottingham, UK, which helpfully tells us all of the places where people got a fine for leaving dog poo!

It is important to respect the license specified by the publisher of the data, and to use the data only for things allowed by the license. For us to be allowed to use this data, Nottingham City Council asks us to provide an acknowledgement to let people know where the data originally came from, and a link to the license, like this:
